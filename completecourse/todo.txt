// TODO: full-text searching UI? (or just combine title search and full-text search results)
// TODO: highlight search term on page, with next/prev button in search box
// TODO: (BUG) new Habitat projects open to video page at first (?)
// TODO: when scrolling through content, check off sections that might not have triggered the usual "completed" scrolling trigger (ie, check for sequential completions)
// TODO: tighten up TOC look and feel (maybe: a's without tree-toggler don't have to be padded so far to the right)
// TODO: replace the timeout in iframe-holder's height checking with imagesLoaded, etc
// TODO: the Unleashed CSS causes an ugly scrolling jump when a new iframe section is loaded via infinite scrolling

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// DONE: get sample course to load and work correctly on InformIT the same way the test page does
// DONE: make the same code work locally and on InformIT
// DONE: multiple test courses in subfolders under "completecourse"?
// DONE: expand/collapse button is no longer working
// DONE: tag new content and process via converter (.rr-updated and .rr-update)
// DONE: shouldn't images be zoomable?
// DONE: better tracking of the TOC via headers
// DONE: check to see Habitat output headers can be tracked in the TOC for scrolling purposes
// DONE: add a "previous section" button/header
// DONE: make the previous button return the first section with the new src (as opposed to the last section with that new src)
// DONE: re-implement TOC searching
// TODONT: Habitat external resource upload (or just link) capability [link to S3]
// TODONT: test server options? (completecourse folder?) [completecourse]
// DONE: implement content searching (using pre-created index, ala HCW, using lunr)
// DONE: finish searching and refactor the loading of the index file (as .json, preferably?) [left it as .js for simplicity]
// DONE: when switching to new sections via an anchor, it doesn't actually take you to the anchor [line was commented out?!]
// DONE: handle not finding a search_index.js
